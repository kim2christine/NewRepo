any data that you want to store globally (visible to the entire app) can reside here
look into the context APi to see a more industry standard way of doing this (we'll talk later) */

    //Think about your requirements when storing state globally
    //you only NEED to globally store data you intend to use in multiple components
    //but you could optimize you code by using global storage to reduce calls to your API

    //we could also store things like base URLs (which I won't use)
    baseUrl:"http://localhost:8080",
    baseReimbursementUrl:"http://localhost:8080/reimbursement"

    //TODO: store our incoming JWT 

}

//Side note: typically all global user data will get populated upon successful login
//Other side note: There's no built in getter/setter mechanisms, which would be nice for encap.

//another one: For a solution like this, we should probably use local/session storage, for those getters/setters as as data that persists on page reload
